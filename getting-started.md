Just like adding new experiments or new pedagogies, adding programming into your courses requires time and planning. It is important to identify the specific learning objectives you want to reinforce by incorporating programming. Of course learning to program in python can be a learning objective in itself, and is also a pre-requisite for utilizing it to enhance other learning objectives.  The [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](https://molssi.org/) has developed outstanding [introductory python programming](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/) resources for scientists.
In particular, for a "quick start", we recommend

- Installation of Anaconda Python 3.6+ (see [setup instructions](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/setup.html))

- [Basics of Python syntax](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/01-introduction/index.html)

- [Manipulating data with NumPy](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/04-tabular_data/index.html)

- [Plotting data with MatPlotLib](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/05-plotting/index.html)

- [Writing custom functions](https://education.molssi.org/python_scripting_cms/06-functions/index.html)

Note that some of the example notebooks on the [Worksheets](https://escip.github.io/Worksheets/) require several more advanced features of python, numpy, and matplotlib.  Some additional resources beyond the MolSSI lessons above include

- [Animation with MatPlotLib](https://towardsdatascience.com/animations-with-matplotlib-d96375c5442c)

- [Linear Algebra with NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.linalg.html)


<!--The focus of the [first ESCIP miniworkshop](https://escip.github.io/workshops/2020) will be on designing python programming excercises that support existing learning objectives.  Content developed from this workshop will be shared through this site.-->
