# “Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP)” Workshop

Contact person: Grace Stokes, Santa Clara University, (<gstokes@scu.edu>)

The goal for this meeting is to bring together chemistry, physics, and astronomy faculty to share existing resources and develop new Python coding exercises using Jupyter Notebooks to teach undergraduate science courses that are not computationally-focused (targeting novice programmers). At this workshop, we will share lived experiences (successes/pitfalls) of instructors who have incorporated coding exercises into science courses. Newer users will work together with experienced faculty to develop new modules for use in the classroom. As a work product of the conference, the attendees will help design and contribute to a web-based repository of Jupyter Notebooks and resources for implementing them most effectively.  

This “ESCIP Workshop” will be held on July 6-8, 2020 in Tucson, AZ (starting 5 pm July 6 and concluding by 12 pm July 8). This workshop is for anyone planning to incorporate Jupyter Notebooks into their courses or already has and wants to evolve or refine their materials. 
Thanks to support from the Cottrell Scholar Collaborative, all costs (including housing and meals) associated with the workshop are covered. If travel costs will be participation-limiting, a limited number of scholarships are available. We also anticipate being able to offer a modest honorarium upon publication of a Python exercise in the ESCIP repository. If you are interested in participating, please complete this [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScM1ce7vc0OhwI-_IQBAItNDtgbHVqhDL_HoqosBjTugwKU2g/viewform) by Monday, March 5, 2020.
