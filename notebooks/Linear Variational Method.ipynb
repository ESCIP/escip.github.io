    "### Questions To Think About!\n",
    "1.  Is the energy you calculated above higher or lower than the ground state energy of the ordinary particle in a box system (without the delta function potential)?\n",
    "Answer:  The energy calculated to approximate the ground state energy of the PIB + Potential using the linear variational method is higher than the true PIB ground state energy (0.165 atomic units for the PIB + Potential compared to 0.0493 atomic units for the ordinary PIB).  The addition of the potential should increase the ground state energy because it is repulsive.\n",
    "2.  Why do you think mixing in functions that correspond to excited states in the ordinary particle in a box system actually helped to improve (i.e. lower) your energy in the system with the delta function potential?\n",
    "Answer:  Certain excited states (all states with even $n$) go to zero at the center of the box, and the repulsive potential is localized to the center of the box.  Therefore, all excited states with even $n$ will move electron density away from the repulsive potential, which can potentially loer the energy.\n",
    "3.  Increase the number of basis functions to 6 (so that ${\\bf H}$ is a 6x6 matrix and ${\\bf c}$ is a vector with 6 entries) and repeat your calculation of the variational estimate of the ground state energy.  Does the energy improve (lower) compared to what it was when 3 basis functions were used?\n",
    "Answer:  Yes, the energy improves.  With 3 basis functions, the ground state energy is approximated to be 0.165 atomic units and with 6 basis functions, the ground state energy is approximated to be 0.155 atomic units.  The added flexibility of these additional basis functions (specifically more basis functions with $n$ even) allows greater flexibility in optimizing a wavefunction that describes an electron effectively avoiding the repulsive potential in the center of the box."
