    "# Fitting Models to Data (Part 2)\n",
    "[Prof. Ryan Trainor, Franklin & Marshall College](https://ryantrainor.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- To introduce the role of measurement uncertainties in model evaluation\n",
    "- To compare logarithmic and linear scaling for visualizing data\n",
    "- To estimate the uncertainty on inferred model parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this workbook, students should be able to\n",
    "- Include measurement uncertainties in the presentation of data and model fitting\n",
    "- Compute the Chi-square value for a model and use it to evaluate the goodness of fit\n",
    "- Use logarithmic scaling to recognize and evaluate powerlaw relationships\n",
    "- Use comments to document their code and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "- This notebook assumes that the student has already completed Part 1 of this Model Fitting activity and is familiar with its prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependencies\n",
    "This notebook requires the standard libraries for scientific Python (numpy, SciPy) as well as the Astropy library. Astropy is included in the full installation of the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) of Python, or it can be installed on its own by running `conda install astropy` or `pip install astropy`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Review: Plotting the data\n",
    "Our first step is to **create the same plot we made in the final step of Part 1 of the Model Fitting activity**: i.e., to make a plot of luminosity vs. mass that includes the best-fit power-law function. *You do not need to include the linear or quadratic curves we considered in that activity in this plot.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- Feel free to copy and paste code from Part 1, but try to leave out any unnecessary commands: this is a good exercise to see what is the minimal amount of code you need to make this plot!\n",
    "- You will need the data file from Part 1 if you do not have it. You can download the data at this link or using the `wget` command in the cell below.\n",
    "- As you write or copy your code, practice using **comments**. Remember that comments are sections of code that are not read by python---they only exist to help you (or other people) understand what your code is doing. A comment starts with a # sign, and everything after the # on the same line is ignored by python. **For each line or section of 2-3 lines that you copy from your Fitting Models to Data (Part 1) code, add a comment to explain what your code is doing in that section and why you need it.**\n",
    "- While you're looking at your previous lab, make sure you refresh your memory about the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) and how it relates to the best-fit line. You'll need this information later for Checkpoint 1.\n"

    "### CHECKPOINT 1\n",
    "If you are completing this activity in class, stop here and check your plot with your instructor or TA before you continue. You may want to think about the following questions in advance:\n",
    "1. What does the \"residual sum of squares\" (RSS) mean, and how does it relate to your best-fit line?\n",
    "2. Which stars in your plot have the the most precisely-determined luminosities? Which have the most uncertain luminosities?\n",
    "3. Does your best-fit line seem consistent with your data, given the uncertainties in your fit?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a logarithmic plot\n",
    "One thing you might notice about your plot above is that most of the points are all clustered together at very small values in the bottom-left corner. This is a common issue in astronomy, where we often deal with numbers that cover many orders of magnitude in scale---if you make your plot big enough to accommodate the big numbers, then you can barely see the differences among the small numbers!\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to deal with this is to use a plot with **logarithmic scaling**: this will change our x and y axes to show powers of 10 instead of linear values. Python has an easy way to do this by adding a single command to the script for our plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we have data that is evenly distributed on either the x or y axes but heavily skewed on the other axis. In these situations, you can use `plt.semilogx()` to make the x axis logarithmic while leaving the y axis on a linear scale, while `plt.semilogy()` does the opposite. If both axes should be shown logarithmically, we can use `plt.loglog()`. Re-create your plot from above (with the errorbars) and try adding one of these commands. Test all three commands and decide as a group which one makes the data easiest to see."

    "\n",
    "One other thing you may find is that our power-law model that looked so good in linear space suddenly looks like a poor fit, especially for the low masses: it systematically misses all of the low-mass points! What's going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we made our fit to *minimize the RSS*: we wanted a line that was \"as close as possible\" to *all* of the points, and each point was treated equally. This means that being off by 1 L$_\\odot$ from our *largest* luminosity was just as bad as being off by 1 L$_\\odot$ from our *smallest* luminosity. However, that doesn't really make sense---1 L$_\\odot$ is a tiny fraction of the total luminosity of our bright stars, but it's a huge fraction for our faint stars. Also, and more importantly, remember what we saw for our error bars: the largest luminosities are the most uncertain, whereas the small values are more precisely known in our data. With this in mind, we should focus on trying to *get a better fit to the points we know precisely*, even if it means we get a slightly worse fit to the other points. That is, we need to give the points with small uncertainties additional **weight**, so that they count more in the fit.\n",

Note that if don't divide by $\\sigma_i$ (or if $\\sigma=1$ for every point) then the $\\chi^2$ value is equivalent to the RSS.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Create a function** that will calculate the $\\chi^2$ value for arbitrary arrays `yobs`, `ypred`, and `sigma`.\n",
