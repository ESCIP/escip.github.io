<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Begin by watching this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI">brief (3 minute) YouTube video introduction to Google Colab</a> and/or <a class="reference external" href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb">reading this short (1 page) introductory explanation</a></p></li>
<li><p>Colab notebooks consist of text cells (like this one) and program code cells, like the one shown below.  Code cells are executed by typing the Cmd+Enter keys (or Ctrl-Enter). You can also execute a code cell by mousing over the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[</span> <span class="pre">]</span></code> symbol in the upper left hand side of the code cell—when you hover over it it will turn into a “play” button, and clicking the play button will execute the code cell. You can find other options for executing groups of cells in the “Runtime” menu above.</p></li>
<li><p>Start by executing the code cell below (the one that begins with the line <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">pandas</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">pd</span></code>).  This loads (“imports”) the required software modules that will be used in the assignment.</p></li>

<p>What do each of these program modules do?  You can think of them as being like a library of books that accomplish program tasks.  In general, they can be quite complicated.  In most cases, you will never learn all of the functionality of a module, and will have to use the documentation to help you determine the relevant parts for solving your problem.  It is useful to have a general sense of the types of tasks that each of modules do, so that you can find the appropriate functionality.</p>

<p>Like other programming languages, Python includes variables and functions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Variable</strong> : a reserved memory location to store values.
Simply, it’s like a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program. For example to create a variable named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">number</span></code> and assign its value as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">100</span></code>:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">100</span>

<li><p><strong>Function</strong> : a block of code which only runs when it is called. Functions are defined using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">def</span></code> keyword. Functions can take user-provided input values, called <strong>arguments</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let’s define an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">absolute_value</span></code> function as below, which takes one argument, the number for which the absolute value should be calculated.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">absolute_value</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">num</span><span class="p">):</span>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">num</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">num</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The output of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">absolute_value(2)</span></code> is 2, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">absolute_value(-4)</span></code> is 4.</p>

<p>Now let’s load in the training and test datasets, which are stored on GitHub. To do this, we will need to use a <strong>module</strong>.
Using a built-in method of a module is carried out by writing: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[module_name].[method]</span></code></p>
<p>For example, to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read_csv</span></code> method of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pandas</span></code> module: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pd.read_csv()</span></code>.  With this method, CSV files are read as a <strong>DataFrame</strong> structure, which is similar to a table. For more on DataFrames:</p>

<h2>Data Selection with Pandas<a class="headerlink" href="#data-selection-with-pandas" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>We will often need to access the values stored in particular positions in a variable. We can do this using the indices corresponding to that position:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iloc[row</span> <span class="pre">index,</span> <span class="pre">column</span> <span class="pre">index]</span> </code>is used for position based data selection</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:</span></code> is used for selecting a range of index values</p></li>
<li><p>Note that in Python, index values start from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iloc[1:3,0]</span></code> : select row indices 1 to 2 (i.e., second and third rows) and the first column</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iloc[:,0]</span></code> : select all rows and the first column</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iloc[:,2:5]</span></code>: select all rows and column indices 2 to 4 (i.e., third through fifth columns)</p></li>

<h1>Plotting Spectra<a class="headerlink" href="#plotting-spectra" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Before continuing, let’s look at the spectra of a few molecules to see what they look like.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For visualization: <a class="reference external" href="https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/">plotly- line chart</a></p></li>
<li><p>You can add a trace by using

<li><p>You can choose which spectra to plot by changing the index values below</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the index values below refer to the row numbers in the training data DataFrame. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">idx_notCarbonyl=1</span></code> selects the molecule in row 0 of the training data, which is hexanal. If you want to select 12-selenazole in row 3 instead, change the line of code to read <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">idx_notCarbonyl=3</span></code>.</p>

<p>Notice that the spectra span the same frequency range, but the maximum intensity value is different for each molecule.</p>

<h1>Data Preprocessing<a class="headerlink" href="#data-preprocessing" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Before carrying out the machine learning analysis, we will need to preprocess the data to put it in a standard form. There are several steps involved: normalization, thresholding, splitting attribute and label, and data balancing.</p>
<section id="normalization">
<h2>Normalization<a class="headerlink" href="#normalization" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In practice, different IR spectra may be recorded at different molecular concentrations, so the absolute intensities may not be directly comparable. Therefore we will <strong>normalize</strong> the data before carrying out the analysis.</p>
<p>We will apply a type of normalization called <strong>min-max normalization</strong> to each “instance” (i.e., molecule) and update the data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For each molecule, the spectral intensities will be scaled to <strong>range from 0 to 1</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We will use the <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html">MinMaxScaler()</a> method</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will define a function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df_normalize</span></code> to carry out this normalization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first argument in the parentheses following the function name represents the data to be normalized</p></li>
<li><p>The second argument represents the column index where the frequency data start. If you don’t provide this argument, the function uses a default value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>As an example, if the frequency data in the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ex_data</span></code> starts in column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4</span></code>, you would write: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">df_normalize(ex_data,4)</span></code></p></li>

<p>We expect that intensities near 0 won’t provide much useful information for the classification. Therefore we will choose a threshold intensity and set all intensity values below the threshold equal to 0.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the spectra of a few molecules and then choose the threshold. (Again you can choose which spectra to plot by changing the index values.)</p>

<p>We will define a function called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">applyThreshold</span></code> to apply the threshold chosen above to the training and test data:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This function uses the <strong>numpy “where”</strong> method to replace intensity values below the threshold with the value 0</p></li>
<li><p>The first argument in the parentheses following the function name represents the data to be thresholded</p></li>
<li><p>The second argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">i</span></code> represents the column index where the frequency data start. If you don’t provide this argument, the function uses a default value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>As an example, if the frequency data in the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ex_data</span></code> starts in column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4</span></code>, you would write: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">applyThreshold(ex_data,4)</span></code></p></li>

<h2>Split Attribute and Label<a class="headerlink" href="#split-attribute-and-label" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Notice that the training and test DataFrames contain the molecule name and label in addition to the spectral data. Now we need to separate the information about whether or not the molecule contains a carbonyl from the spectral intensities. We will do this by creating two new variables, X and Y:</p>
<p>X is an <strong>attribute</strong>, all the <strong>normalized intensities</strong></p>
<p>Y is a <strong>label</strong> which is the <strong>presence of a carbonyl group</strong>. <strong>If the molecule has a carbonyl then Y = 1; if it doesn’t, then Y = 0</strong>.</p>
<p>Define a function to split the labels and attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The first argument in the parentheses following the function name represents the data to be split</p></li>
<li><p>The second argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start_X</span></code> represents the column index where the frequency data start. If you don’t provide this argument, the function uses a default value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The third argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">end_X</span></code> represents the column index where the frequency data end. If you don’t provide this argument, the function uses a default value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">None</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start_Y</span></code> represents the column index where the label data start. If you don’t provide this argument, the function uses a default value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The fifth argument <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">end_Y</span></code> represents the column index where the frequency data end. If you don’t provide this argument, the function uses a default value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>As an example, if the frequency data in the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ex_data</span></code> start in column <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5</span></code> and the label data are in columns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">4</span></code>, you would write: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">splitXY(ex_data,5,None,3,5)</span></code></p></li>

<h3>SMOTE (Synthetic minority oversampling technique)<a class="headerlink" href="#smote-synthetic-minority-oversampling-technique" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Imbalanced training data can sometimes lead to poor classification performance because the model might simply learn to ignore the less common (“minority”) class. To address this possibility, we will use a technique called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversampling_and_undersampling_in_data_analysis#SMOTE">SMOTE</a> which generates new instances of the minority class by interpolating between the existing instances. (Note that if the two classes are sufficiently distinct, as is the case here, a data balancing step may not be required – but we’ll do it anyway.)</p>

(The synthetic spectrum will vary each time you run SMOTE.)

<h2>Introduction to Machine Learning Models<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-machine-learning-models" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that the data preprocessing is done, we’re finally ready to build our machine learning models! Initially we will use two different classifier models implemented in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code> library:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Decision Tree</p></li>
<li><p>Random Forest</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A few other useful classifiers contained in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code>, which you can test later, are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>k</em>-Nearest Neighbors (<em>k</em>-NN)</p></li>
<li><p>Naive Bayes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These models all have a set of default parameters, but you can adjust the parameters by providing additional arguments for the functions. Information is provided in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">scikit-learn</span></code> information link. Here we will use the default parameters for the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithm.</p>
<p>Below are descriptions of these four models.</p>
<p><strong>Decision Tree</strong></p>
<p>Decision Tree uses a tree-like model of decisions. It models the data in a tree structure, in which each leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are the tree’s internal nodes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.08-random-forests.html">Python Data Science Handbook</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree">Wikipedia</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html">scikit-learn</a> documentation</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Random Forest</strong></p>
<p>Random Forest builds a collection of Decision Trees, where each tree is trained with a random subset of training instances and a random subset of attributes. The final label is determined as the most common label among the collection of trees.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.08-random-forests.html">Python Data Science Handbook</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest">Wikipedia</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html">scikit-learn</a> documentation</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>k</em>-Nearest Neighbors</strong></p>
<p><em>k</em>-NN groups the training data according to a similarity metric. A new instance is then classified by taking the most common label among the <em>k</em> nearest neighbors (i.e., the <em>k</em> most similar members of the training dataset), where <em>k</em> is an adjustable parameter.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html">scikit-learn</a> documentation</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Naive Bayes</strong></p>
<p>Naive Bayes algorithms are based on Bayes’ theorem. The term “Naive” refers to the assumption that input features are independent. Although this assumption is often violated, the model can still perform well. Gaussian Naive Bayes is one widely used implementation of this algorithm.</p>

<h1>Testing Machine Learning Models<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-machine-learning-models" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Now that we have trained our machine learning models, we can use them on test data. There are a few steps in this process:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Label Prediction:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will use the fitted machine learning models to predict the labels (with or without carbonyl) for the test dataset. We will store the predictions made by the fitted models in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Y_pred</span></code> list.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Model Evaluation:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to see how well the models performed. There are <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_of_binary_classifiers">a few ways</a> to assess the accuracy of a machine learning model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Accuracy : the proportion of the total number of predictions that were correct</p></li>
<li><p>Sensitivity or Recall : the proportion of actual positive cases (here, molecules with a carbonyl) which are correctly identified</p></li>
<li><p>Specificity : the proportion of actual negative cases (here, molecules without a carbonyl) which are correctly identified</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>False Negative and False Positive Group</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we can analyze the error cases, where the model’s prediction was wrong. A false positive (FP) is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class. A false negative (FN) is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class. Sometimes we might be able to understand why the prediction was incorrect for a particular molecule by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Looking at the molecular structure. (We will use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RDkit</span></code> module for this task.)
-Looking at the molecular spectrum.</p></li>

<h1>FP / FN Group Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#fp-fn-group-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>Now let’s look more carefully at the FPs and FNs. First we need to determine which predictions were incorrect and separate them into the two types of errors.</p>
<p>Note that for both the Decision Tree and the Random Forest, we saved the predictions in the same variable: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Y_pred</span></code>. Thus <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Y_pred</span></code> currently contains the predictions of whichever analysis you ran most recently. If you went straight through the file, that would be the Random Forest model.</p>
<p>Thus to see the FPs and FNs for the Decision Tree model, we will first rerun the prediction using the Decision Tree model.
