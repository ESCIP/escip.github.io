    "# Dyanmics of particle in a box with a delta potential\n",
    "[Jay Foley and Lane Tolley, University of North Carolina Charlotte](https://foleylab.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives\n",
    "- To demonstrate the use of the numerical methods, including the Euler method and the Runge-Kutta method, to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation\n",
    "- To illustrate the dynamics of a particle in a box with a delta potential\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this workbook, students should be able to\n",
    "- Express the time-dependent Schrodinger equation using matrices for the Hamiltonian operator and vectors for the wavefunction\n",
    "- Utilize matrix-vector operations in `numpy` to compte time-derivatives of the wavefunction\n",
    "- Utilize numerical integration methods, particularly the Euler method and the Runge-Kutta method, to evolve the wavefunction in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "We will investigate the particle in a box with a delta potential that was explored in the notebook on the [Linear Variational Method](https://escip.io/notebooks/linear_variational_method.html), but in the context of the time-dependence induced by the delta potential on an initial state, rather than through the application of the variational method to identify stationary states of this Hamiltonian.  We will choose an initial state to be the ground state of the ordinary particle in a box system, so again we will find it useful to build the Hamiltonian matrix in the basis of\n",
    "the particle in a box states, and to express the wavefunction in terms of the amplitudes of each of these basis states.\n",
