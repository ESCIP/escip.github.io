Welcome to Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP).

ESCIP is a collaborative dedicated to providing easy access to
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) for chemistry, physics and
astronomy education. We aim to build faculty networks and facilitate
the sharing of instructional modules through virtual and in-person
workshops, as well as a [repository](/Worksheets/) of Jupyter
Notebooks for educators and students.
