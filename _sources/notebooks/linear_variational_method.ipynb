    "We can write the Hamiltonian for this system between $x=0$ and $x=10$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\delta(x-5), $$\n",
    "and we notice that this looks very similar to the Hamiltonian we know from the ordinary particle in a box\n",
    "except for the presence of this peculiar spikey potential right in the middle of the box.  We could try to find [the exact eigenfunctions for this Hamiltonian](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1001.0311.pdf), but we can also obtain insights and reasonably good results utilizing approximate methods, such as the [Variational Method](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Quantum_Mechanics/17%3A_Quantum_Calculations/Variational_Method#:~:text=The%20Variational%20Method%20is%20a,the%20known%20and%20approximated%20energies) or [Perturbation Theory](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Book%3A_Quantum_States_of_Atoms_and_Molecules_(Zielinksi_et_al)/09%3A_The_Electronic_States_of_the_Multielectron_Atoms/9.03%3A_Perturbation_Theory).  Here we will use the Variational Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Form of the trial wavefunction\n",
    "In particular, we will optimize the trial wavefunction given by \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Phi(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^N c_n \\psi_n(x)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the expansion coefficients $c_n$ are real numbers\n",
    "and $\\psi_n(x)$ are the energy eigenfunctions of the ordinary particle in a box that has no potential\n",
    "between $x=0$ and $x=L$.  In particular, these eigenfunctions have the form\n",

    "#### Atomic Units\n",
    "We will express our Hamiltonian in atomic units where $\\hbar = 1$ and $m = 1$, so we can write the Hamiltonian in \n",

For the ordinary particle in a box, the Hamiltonian only contains $\\hat{T}$, so we can note that the particle in a box energy eigenfunctions obey the following eigenvalue equation with the kinetic energy operator (in atomic units)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Solving the Linear Variational Problem\n",
    "The Linear Variational Method is carried out by minimizing $E_{trial}$ with respect to the expansion coefficients in $\\Phi(x)$.  This leads\n",
    "to the condition that the partial derivative of the trial energy with \n",
    "respect to each expansion coefficient is zero:\n",

    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c_m} E_{trial} = 0 \\; \\; \\forall \\; m.\n",

    "coefficients satisfy the following equations:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_{trial} c_m = \\sum_{n=1}^N H_{nm} c_n,\n",

Increase the number of basis functions to 50 (so that ${\\bf H}$ is a 50x50 matrix and ${\\bf c}$ is a vector with 50 entries) and repeat your calculation of the variational estimate of the ground state energy.  Does the energy improve (lower) compared to what it was when 3 basis functions were used?  Do you notice any difference in the plot of the variational estimate of the ground-state probability density?"
