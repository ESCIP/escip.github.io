# Contributing to ESCIP

Anyone can contribute to ESCIP!  If you would like to contribute a new notebook, or make revisions and/or additions to an existing notebook, the best way is to submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
