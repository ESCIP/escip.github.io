# Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP)

```{admonition} What is ESCIP about?

- ESCIP is a collaborative dedicated to providing easy access to
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) for chemistry, physics and
astronomy education. 
- We aim to build faculty networks and facilitate
the sharing of instructional modules through virtual and in-person
workshops, as well as a repository of Jupyter Notebooks for educators and students.
