ESCIP brings together faculty who teach quantitative skills to undergraduate students using a common programming language and platform. Python is a widely-used, open-source programming language and is an increasingly popular tool within the scientific research community. The free Jupyter Notebook platform features written documentation and detailed explanations alongside executable code. The Python/Jupyter notebook platform allows scaffolded entry points for novice programmers. The resources developed and disseminated from the proposed workshop will focus on Python-based exercises for undergraduate science students.
