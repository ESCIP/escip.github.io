[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a widely-used, open-source programming language and is an
increasingly popular tool within the scientific research
community. The free [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) platform features written
documentation and detailed explanations alongside executable
code. This allows scaffolded entry points for novice programmers to
interact with concepts and models that are inaccessible in a
traditional textbook-based approach. [Notebooks](/Notebooks/) found on
the ESCIP website serve both as examples and ready-to-use material
developed from the ESCIP workshops and by the broader community.
