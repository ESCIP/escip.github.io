Please consider joining us for a Cottrell Scholar Collaborative (CSC) virtual workshop entitled “Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP).” The goal for the ESCIP workshop is to bring together chemistry, physics, and astronomy faculty to share existing resources and develop new Python coding exercises using Jupyter Notebooks to teach undergraduate science courses that are not computationally-focused (targeting novice programmers). The topics we will be discussing are closely tied to the virtual Cottrell Scholar Conference 2020 theme of “Online Education.” 

### Part 1) Using Python programming to enhance existing learning objectives

Friday, June 19, 2020 from 9 am - 12 pm Pacific, 12 pm - 3 pm Eastern

### Part 2) Incorporating programming into multiple courses across the science curriculum

Tuesday, June 30, 2020 from 9 am - 12 pm Pacific, 12 pm - 3 pm Eastern 

This two-part virtual ESCIP workshop will help attendees incorporate Python programming into the classes we teach (both online and in-person) and get us excited for the in-person ESCIP workshop, which has been postponed until next summer (July 5-7, 2021), immediately before the in-person 2021 Cottrell Scholar conference. Even if your schedule only allows you to attend one of the two parts, you are still welcome to participate.

Our discussions are organized by the PIs of our Cottrell Scholar Collaborative (see below) and will be moderated by two Python education experts from the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI): [Dr. Jessica Nash](https://molssi.org/molssi-software-scientist-dr-jessica-nash/) and [Dr. Ashley Ringer McDonald](https://chemistry.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/ashley_mcdonald).

To learn more about the virtual ESCIP workshop and express interest, please fill out this brief [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyTNnjwZ37-7-L5WDohQNOqmUdZOM3F2XpkUaFhsFM1CJgMg/viewform) before June 15, 2020.

Upon receipt of your survey, we will send you a link to our ZOOM meeting and relevant workshop information.
