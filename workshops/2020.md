# Mini-workshops 2020

In June 2020, ESCIP hosted two virtual workshops covering topics related to the Cottrell Scholar Conference 2020 theme of “Online Education.” For these mini-workshops, 58 educators attended, including Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy faculty from both R1 and primarily undergraduate institutions.

#### Part 1) Using Python programming to enhance existing learning objectives

Friday, June 19, 2020 from 9 am - 12 pm Pacific, 12 pm - 3 pm Eastern

#### Part 2) Incorporating programming into multiple courses across the science curriculum

Tuesday, June 30, 2020 from 9 am - 12 pm Pacific, 12 pm - 3 pm Eastern 

The goal of this two-part virtual ESCIP workshop was to help attendees incorporate Python programming into the classes we teach (both online and in-person) and to get us excited for the in-person ESCIP workshop, which has been postponed until next summer (July 5-7, 2021), immediately before the in-person 2021 Cottrell Scholar conference. 

Discussions were organized by the [PIs](../team) of our Cottrell Scholar Collaborative and were moderated by two Python education experts from the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI): [Dr. Jessica Nash](https://molssi.org/molssi-software-scientist-dr-jessica-nash/) and [Dr. Ashley Ringer McDonald](https://chemistry.calpoly.edu/content/faculty/ashley_mcdonald).
