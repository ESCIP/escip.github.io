### Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP)

```{admonition} What is ESCIP about?

- ESCIP is a collaborative initiative dedicated to developing and disseminating 
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) for chemistry, physics and
astronomy education. 
- Most importantly ESCIP is a netowwork of educators passionate about lowering the barriers for students to adopt modern practices in scientific computing, data analysis and visualization. 
- We provide trainings for instructors new to python and hold regular workshops at universities across the nation. Check out the upcoming and previous workshops held so far.
