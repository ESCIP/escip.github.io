### Enhancing Science Courses by Integrating Python (ESCIP)

```{admonition} What is ESCIP about?

- ESCIP is a collaborative initiative dedicated to providing easy access to
[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) for chemistry, physics and
astronomy education. All content is open source but we still do highly apprecite any credit to ESCIP.
- We provide trainings for instructors new to python and hold regular workshops at universities across the nation.
